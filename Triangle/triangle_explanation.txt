This task was to create a function that identifies the type of triangle from three given value inputs of traingle side lengths. 

Designing the function begain with defining the five possible outputs of the function: 
    "EQUILATERAL"
    "ISOSCLESE"
    "SCALENE"
    "RIGHT"
    "ERROR"

Next the circumstances for each of the outputs was determined: 
    3 inputs of the same value -> EQUILATERAL
    2 inputs of the same value -> ISOSCLESE
    values that satisfy Pythagoras' theorem -> RIGHT
    any other valud input -> SCALENE

Finally, error handling and invalid input was determined and directed to the "ERROR" output.
Invalid inputs included: 
    Non-numerical values
    Values that do not satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem
    Negative/Zero values
    Any other values that do not meet the requirments of the four triangle categories (as a catch-all for any other invalid input)

A number of tests were created to ensure the functionality of the program: 
    Correct identification of each triangle type, regardless of order of variable inputs. 
    Correct identification of negative side values
    Correct identification of values that do not meet the Triangle Inequality Theorem
